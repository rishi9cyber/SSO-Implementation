# Single Sign-On (SSO) with SAML and OAuth

# SSO-Implementation
Single Sign-On (SSO) implementation using SAML and OAuth 2.0 with Okta/Auth0 as the identity provider

## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of **Single Sign-On (SSO)** using **SAML** for authentication and **OAuth 2.0** for authorization. It showcases how users can log in once and access multiple applications securely.

## Key Features
- **SAML-based Authentication**: Secure user login using SAML.
- **OAuth 2.0 Authorization**: Grant access to resources using OAuth.
- **Integration with Identity Providers (IdPs)**: Works with popular IdPs like Okta, Auth0, or Azure AD.

## Use Cases
- Enterprise applications requiring secure user authentication.
- Cloud-based services needing seamless user access.
- Compliance with security standards like GDPR and HIPAA.

## Technologies Used
- **SAML**: For secure authentication.
- **OAuth 2.0**: For authorization.
- **Node.js/Express.js**: For building the web app (optional).

## How It Works
1. The user logs in through the Identity Provider (IdP).
2. The IdP verifies the userâ€™s identity using SAML.
3. The application grants access to resources using OAuth 2.0.
4. The user can now access multiple applications without logging in again.

## Why This Project?
- **Security**: Protects user data with industry-standard protocols.
- **User Experience**: Simplifies login processes for end-users.
- **Scalability**: Works for small businesses and large enterprises.
